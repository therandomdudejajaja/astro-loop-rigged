     * picked up in the desert. It was left. It festered. It has come back.**

     * It accuses whoever is flying. That is not a continuity slip — the reckoning is
     * reachable by any of the twelve, and the crystal has been alone long enough that it no
     * longer distinguishes. Everyone who comes is the one who left it.

     * it whispers rest, stay, come back. The trap is never stated out loud: the player feels it.
     *

     * silence is the refusal. (This used to say ASTRO, and pointed at a first word "in the
     * ghost phase" — a phase stage 3 deleted. The property survives the fight it was written
     * for: whoever is flying, they do not answer.)
