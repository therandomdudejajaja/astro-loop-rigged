     *
     * It lives here, beside the two category volumes above, because it is the same kind of number
     * and it was missed for exactly that reason. When the February normalization pass (84c3a2fb)
     * re-baked the library quieter, the compensation was applied to the *category* volumes — that
     * is what the two "was 0.25" comments above record. `sfx_text_tick` is not in either category
     * (it falls to [volumeSfxCombat], which stayed at 1.0), and its trim was instead hardcoded as
     * `0.15f` at two call sites in GameSurfaceView. It got the quieter bake and none of the
     * compensation.
     *
     * Measured: the sample's peak went −5.7 dB → −15.8 dB in that pass, a 10.1 dB drop. At the old
     * 0.15 trim that put its effective peak at −32.3 dB, under `bgm_heart_to_heart` — roughly 11 dB
     * below the next quietest thing in the game, and inaudible on device. Every other quiet sample
     * (ui_swipe at −19.0, slot_win at −18.5) is played at full call volume; the typewriter was the
     * only one attenuated at its call site.
     *
     * 0.5 restored the effective level the 0.15 was originally chosen to produce (−21.8 dB versus
     * −22.2 dB before the re-bake) — and on device that was still too quiet: audible, but drowned
     * by `bgm_heart_to_heart` (owner, 2026-09-03). So the pre-re-bake mix was itself wrong against
     * this scene's music; restoring history was never going to be enough.
     *
     * 1.0 puts the effective peak at −15.8 dB, level with `sfx_ui_upgrade_select` (−15.0 dB), the
     * loudest of the library's quiet samples. No clipping headroom is at risk: the sample peaks
     * 15.8 dB below full scale and [volumeSfxCombat] is 1.0, so the product cannot reach unity.
     *
     * **This is the ceiling for this lever** — `playSFX` coerces volume into 0f..1f, so there is
     * nothing above 1.0 here. If the tick ever needs to be louder still, the next moves are a
     * hotter re-bake of the sample or ducking the ambient bed under the scene, not this constant.
     * If the sample is re-baked, recompute from its measured peak rather than nudging by ear.

     * intentional repeat in the game at exactly one tick per 0.04s. That is not "far above" the

     * the frame period divides 40 evenly — which it does, since [GameConfig.FRAME_TIME_MS] is
     * `1000L / 120` = 8. That leaves a margin of zero. The gap actually measured is between two
     * `System.currentTimeMillis()` samples taken inside `update()`, and it drifts by a fraction of
     * a millisecond with how much work each frame did before reaching the tick — so a large share
     * of ticks measured 39 and were dropped, in the middle of the story's climax.

     * volley across several milliseconds), while leaving 24ms of headroom under the typewriter.
     * The invariant to keep: **this must stay well under the fastest cadence any caller actually
     * intends**, not merely under the fastest one somebody remembered to check.
