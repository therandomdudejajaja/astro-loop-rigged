/**
 * **VOLLEY** — telegraphed bursts fired at where you *are*.
 *
 * *Can you keep moving and still turn to shoot?* Second in the teaching order: PULSE
 * lets you find a gap and sit in it, and this is what stops that working.
 *
 * **The telegraph is the pattern's own first beat, not a separate object.** A burst is
 * three sub-volleys 0.55s apart, each re-aimed at wherever you are by then. The first
 * announces that a burst is happening and roughly where; the next two punish you for
 * still being there. Nothing extra is drawn, and there is no state to keep.
 *
 * **Aiming is toroidal.** A raw delta would fire at a ship a whole field away when it is
 * in fact adjacent across the seam — and hugging an edge is normal, skilful play here,
 * since wrapping is how you escape.
