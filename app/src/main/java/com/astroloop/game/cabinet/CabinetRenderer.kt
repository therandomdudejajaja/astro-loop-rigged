/**
 * Draws BELT RUN as a vector monitor.
 *
 * Three constraints shape every line of this class, all from the design doc:
 * - **Stroke only.** The main game fills its shapes; this one never does. That single
 *   difference is what reads as "the old game" before any effect is applied.
 * - **Bloom is layered low-alpha passes**, never BlurMaskFilter and never an offscreen
 *   pass — `minSdk 24` rules out RenderEffect and the project avoids per-frame bitmaps.
 * - **No curvature and no scanlines.** Both were prototyped and cut. Do not add them.
 *
 * **Beam persistence is cut.** It was tried twice and failed twice: first as a fade of
 * the previous frame, which cannot work at all because a `SurfaceView`'s locked canvas
 * never carries the last frame's pixels; then as an explicit decaying streak, which was
 * barely visible on hardware and drew a rigid stick along the current velocity rather
 * than a trail along the path actually flown. Do not reinstate it without solving the
 * second problem — the streak has to follow position history, not the velocity vector.

     * [topInset] is the display cutout. The GEL still runs to y=0 — a black strip above
     * a coloured bar would look like a rendering fault — but nothing readable is drawn
     * inside the inset. Deliberately a draw parameter rather than part of
     * [CabinetMetrics]: the sim stays resolution-independent, which is the property that
     * makes the fairness maths device-independent.
     *
     * **Reverses design decision 33** (`2026-08-13-arcade-cabinet-finale-design.md`),
     * which chose full opacity. That decision's reasoning was about colour wash and
     * legibility only; it never considered that the playfield is full-bleed underneath,
     * so a fully opaque gel hides every rock — and the player's own ship — the instant
     * either passes under the bar. Getting killed by something you cannot see is the
     * worst kind of unfair, so the gel goes translucent instead. Score and initials keep
     * full brightness and their three-pass glow, which is what carries them over the wash.
     *
     * **No bottom rule.** The bar used to close with a full-width ICE stroke along
     * `barHeight` — a 1px `#EAFBFF` core inside a ~6.5px cyan bloom, the renderer's default
     * phosphor. It was never a considered choice, just [strokePolyline]'s default colour, and
     * on device it read as a white stripe laid across the screen under the pilot's gel rather
     * than as part of the bar. Owner's call, 2026-09-03: dropped. The gel is translucent, so
     * its own edge against the playfield is all the separation the bar needs.
     *
     * If an edge is ever wanted back, tint it to [gelColor] rather than restoring the default
     * ICE — a white lid on a coloured band is the thing that looked wrong — and put it back in
     * BOTH this and [drawCrystalBar], whose geometry is a verbatim copy of this one's.
