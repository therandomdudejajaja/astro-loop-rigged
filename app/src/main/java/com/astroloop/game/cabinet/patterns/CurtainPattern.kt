/**
 * **CURTAIN** — a slow arc unfurling from the crystal, with one opening.
 *
 * *Can you plan ahead instead of reacting?* Fourth in the teaching order, and the only
 * pattern that cannot be survived by reflex: the arc is visible long before it arrives
 * and the hole is somewhere you have to go.
 *
 * **Rebuilt for decision 78.** It used to spawn full-width walls just inside the top or
 * bottom edge, alternating. Device pass 6: *"all patterns should emit from the ship
 * instead of having patterns that start from outside of the screen."* Read against the
 * code, CURTAIN was the only one of the five that did — the other four all spawn at
 * [crystalX]/[crystalY]. The objection is readability, and it lands hardest here: a wall
 * born off-screen cannot be read before it commits you, which is precisely this pattern's
 * job.
 *
 * Bullets are now born at the crystal's surface and travel radially outward, so the arc
 * **widens as it goes** — a curtain unfurling rather than sliding in. Successive arcs
 * point on different bearings, replacing the old top/bottom alternation, and the hole
 * walks within the arc so the answer to the last one is never the answer to the next.
 *
 * **The second pattern the deleted speed floor bought.** At 216 px/s this is slower than
 * the ship, so it can be outrun — and on a torus outrunning it only brings you back to
 * it. In the old camera-following fight that made a threat worthless; here it makes one
 * you have to solve rather than escape.
 *
 * ⚠️ **WHERE THIS COULD GO WRONG, and no test can see it.** Radial fan-out gives an arc
 * the same geometry as a PULSE ring: tight near the body, loose at the edge. The only
 * thing keeping them distinct is that a ring surrounds you and must be threaded, while an
 * arc arrives on one bearing and can be escaped sideways. [ARC_FRAC] is what protects
 * that — at 0.55 the arc covers a little over half the circle and leaves 45% of it
 * completely open. **Widen it toward 1.0 and this stops being CURTAIN and becomes a slow
 * PULSE**, collapsing two of the five patterns into one idea.
 *
 * The distinctions that survive, and they are not small: PULSE emits every 0.8s against
 * this pattern's 4.0s, at 1.5x the speed, through a hole nearly three times wider
 * (678.6px against 237.6px at engagement range). Frequent and forgiving against slow,
 * rare and exact.
