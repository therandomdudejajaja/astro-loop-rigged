/**
 * What the cabinet should play this frame — the decision, split from the playing.
 *
 * Every one of these cues used to be an `if` inside `HangarSurfaceView`, and not one of them
 * had ever been driven: the samples did not exist until 2026-08-29, so the machine had been
 * silently silent since stage 1 and the wiring had never been exercised by a player OR by a
 * test. That is this branch's recurring defect in its purest form — the units are provable
 * and the composition is where it breaks — so the host keeps only the gate and the loop, and
 * everything it would otherwise decide lives here.
 *
 * Pure, Android-free and stateless, for the same reason [CrystalVoice] and [CabinetTakeover]
 * are: a unit test can drive it, and `ReckoningRun`/`CabinetSim` stay unable to touch
 * `SoundManager`.
 *
 * **This is not a mixer.** Per-sound loudness is baked onto a LUFS ladder and the category
 * knobs sit near 1.0 so nothing is attenuated twice; the volumes here are the authored
 * per-call trims that ladder was built against, and they belong with the decision rather
 * than scattered across call sites.
