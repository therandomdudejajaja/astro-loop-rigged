/**
 * One line segment of something that has come apart.
 *
 * Nothing in this game may simply vanish — every removal needs a visible exit. The period-correct answer satisfies that exactly: a destroyed shape
 * separates at its own vertices, each edge becoming a free segment that drifts outward,
 * spins slightly and fades. The death animation is the shape falling apart into the
 * lines it was drawn from.
 *
 * Sim-side rather than renderer-side deliberately. It makes the rule testable, it keeps
 * the wreck deterministic under the injected [Random], and it means a future renderer
 * cannot quietly drop the visual and reintroduce the breach.
 *
 * Debris never collides with anything and never blocks a wave advancing.
 *
 * [x1],[y1]..[x2],[y2] are the endpoints in local space, relative to this segment's own
 * midpoint at [x],[y], so [rot] spins the segment about its middle.

         *
         * 1. **Under `CRYSTAL_DEBRIS_LIFE / 3`, i.e. under 1.0s.** `CrystalDeathTest`
         *    requires the crystal's pieces to linger *more than three times* a rock's —
         *    "far longer" is the ending's whole weight, and the 3.0s it lingers for is
         *    authored — the shatter is meant to run a full three seconds.
         *    So this yields to the crystal, not the other way round. 1.0f lands exactly on
         *    that boundary and fails; 0.8f keeps the ratio at 3.75x.
         * 2. Under `ATTRACT_RESTART_HOLD` (1.4s). `CabinetAttract` restarts its demo only
         *    once the hold expires **and** the debris list is empty, so past 1.4s the wreck
         *    rather than the beat would pace the attract loop — silently lengthening a
         *    beat that has already been signed off on hardware.
