/**
 * A shot. Dies on [life] rather than on distance.
 *
 * The player's shots wrap like everything else on the field. **The crystal's do not**
 * ([hostile]) — §8 of the design: it bounds their lifetime to one playfield crossing,
 * which is what makes fairness rule 3's density figure deterministic, and it reads
 * in-fiction as the crystal not obeying the cabinet's rules.
 *
 * This is the ONE deliberate non-toroidal motion path in `cabinet/`. Everything else in
 * the package goes through [CabinetMetrics.distance] / [CabinetMetrics.wrappedDelta], and
 * a constraint sweep that finds this should read this comment rather than "fixing" it.
 * Note that *collision* against a hostile bullet is still toroidal: the ship is drawn at
 * every wrapped position, so toroidal distance is what matches the picture.
