/**
 * The reckoning's clock: which pattern is running, how tight it has become, and what it
 * emits this frame.
 *
 * Shaped after `CrystalFightSystem` — `update()` returns bullets and the caller spawns
 * them — so this holds **no world state and no reference to the sim**, and every fairness
 * rule is provable over it alone. No `Random`: the same `dt` sequence is the same fight.
 *
 * **The fight advances on DAMAGE** (decision 92): the live pattern is a function of the
 * crystal's health, one per fifth, so all five play for every player by construction —
 * you cannot reach the last fifth without crossing the four before it. Device pass 6
 * killed the crystal mid-WINDMILL on a first attempt and CURTAIN and SHATTER had never
 * been seen; that is what this fixes.
 *
 * Decision 74's HP bands did the same job with a floor pushed in every frame, a fractional
 * carry, and a crystal that stopped reacting mid-pattern. All of it is gone.
 *
 * **Escalation still runs on a clock** ([elapsed]) and must, or a player who dodges
 * perfectly and never shoots would sit in the first pattern for ever.
