 * never where is it but can I afford to turn right now."* That anchoring is also what
 * keeps the radial patterns readable and what gives the wrap meaning, since fleeing
 * carries you around the field and back toward it.
 *
 * The only behaviour here is its own damage arithmetic, and since decision 92 there is
 * barely any: damage comes straight off hp. The bands, their floor and the fractional carry
 * that made damage inside the floor visible are all gone — the pattern follows the health
 * now, so nothing needs to hold the crystal back from dying. See [damage].

         * **This is the hitbox, and since device pass 7 it is also the drawing.** It was
         * 0.09 — 97.2px — back when a corruption-red shell was drawn at exactly this radius
         * and the orb sat small inside it: the shell was what told you where the target
         * ended. With the shell removed the orb had to take that job, so it was scaled up to
         * fill this radius, and the crystal got visibly enormous. Owner: "you made the
         * crystal really big now? why?"
         *
         * The answer is to shrink the RADIUS rather than to draw a small orb inside a large
         * hitbox, which would be a target that lies — shots that visibly miss would count,
         * and count in the player's favour, in a fight the same pass asked to make harder.
         *
         * 0.05 was the first attempt and still read wrong: at 54px it was nearly a LARGE
         * rock (59.4px), which is a glowing ball rather than the object the rest of the game
         * shows you. `renderTimeCrystalOrb` draws the real thing at a 10-unit glow around a
         * 4-unit core — DESIGN units, which the main game's `canvas.scale(renderScale)`
         * turns into 13.3 physical pixels on a Pixel 9 Pro — and that smallness is most of
         * what makes it recognisable. ⚠️ That orb is no
         * longer drawn at all — decision 115 replaced it with a lattice, because the ending
         * is a release and there is no Time Crystal here to depict. The sizing history below
         * is kept because it is why this number moved, not because the orb is still in it.
         *
         * 0.022 — a hair over a SMALL rock — was then flown and judged the other way:
         * *"the red circle is too small."* 0.030 was the first step and drew the same note
         * again, with the size named: *"around the size of a medium asteroid."* So this is
         * `ROCK_MEDIUM_FRAC` exactly — 36.7px — rather than a number near it. It is still
         * well under the 0.05 that read as a ball. **The hitbox moves with it by design:** a shell drawn bigger
         * than the radius would be a target that lies, and counting shots that visibly miss
         * is worse than a target that is small.
