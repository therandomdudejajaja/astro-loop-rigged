/**
 * **SHATTER** — a short, chaotic, very dense burst, then a long silence.
 *
 * *Can you survive without shooting, then punish the quiet?* Last in the teaching order,
 * because it asks for nerve rather than a technique.
 *
 * **This is what proves the no-window design.** §8: it is a phase where shooting is
 * genuinely off the table, followed by one where it is free — *"and no invulnerability
 * flag is involved anywhere. The pattern's own density does the work a state machine
 * would have done."* If a future change makes this survivable while shooting, the whole
 * argument for having no window mechanic weakens with it.
 *
 * **The chaos is deterministic.** Each cluster is rotated by the golden angle from the
 * last, so no two land alike and the sequence never visibly repeats inside a phase — but
 * there is no `Random` anywhere, which every fairness test and the `RECKONING_PHASE_N`
 * jump both depend on.
 *
 * **The cluster itself is evenly spread**, and that is not a contradiction: chaos is
 * *where* a cluster lands, not how it is shaped. An unevenly shaped cluster could put two
 * bullets close enough to close a lane, and nothing would catch it — the shared harness
 * only measures the radial schedule, not the angular geometry.
