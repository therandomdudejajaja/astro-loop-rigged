 * The reckoning's fairness contract, as numbers.

 * The most load-bearing part of the fight this replaces was never its constants — it was
 * that its fairness was unit-tested. That property carries; the numbers do not. Every
 * figure here **derives** from a cabinet constant, so a change to the flight model moves
 * the contract with it rather than leaving a stale literal behind. That has already
 * happened once on this branch: `commitmentDistance()`'s 140px survived in the design doc
 * for days after the function that produced it was deleted.

     *
     * It said: an opening the player must be *standing in* has to be one they can *get to*.
     * Rule 1 measures the hole's WIDTH and would not notice a hole that sweeps faster than
     * the ship can fly. Task 14 found exactly that on hardware — PULSE's gap needed 378px/s
     * at engagement range against a top speed of 302.4, and its rings outran the ship
     * radially too, so there was no escape in either direction.
     *
     * It is retired because **no pattern has such an opening any more.** Device pass 7 took
     * PULSE's gap away (*"it's easy enough right now to dodge even without the gap"*) and
     * CURTAIN's walking hole with it; WINDMILL's arms were always pickets you dive between,
     * which is its whole question. With nothing declaring an occupied opening, the check
     * short-circuited for all five patterns and passed unconditionally — coverage in
     * appearance only, which is worse than no check at all.
     *
     * ⚠️ **Reinstate it with any pattern that brings back a hole you must sit in.** The
     * shape it needs: an angular sweep rate, and `rate * engagementRange(m) <= topSpeed` at
     * every lap through [FAIR_LAPS].
