/**
 * BELT RUN's control: the main game's relative virtual joystick.
 *
 * An origin is planted wherever the finger lands, and the output is the vector from
 * that origin to the finger — dead-zoned, clamped, normalised into direction x
 * magnitude. **The ship's position is never consulted.**
 *
 * That is the entire difference from what device pass 1 shipped, and it fixes three
 * things at once. The ship no longer chases and then orbits a stationary finger. Thrust
 * no longer sags as the ship approaches the touch point. And a still finger inside the
 * dead zone now means genuinely nothing, which is what let the double-tap slop gate and
 * its time-promotion fallback be deleted outright rather than tuned.
 *
 * It also retired an open question rather than answering it: with no ship-relative
 * delta left, there is nothing for the wrap to disagree about, so the feature is
 * toroidal everywhere with no exceptions.
 *
 * Pure — no Android, no MotionEvent. [deadZone] and [maxRadius] are injected in
 * playfield pixels; the host passes `CabinetMetrics.stickDeadZone` / `.stickRadius`.
