/**
 * When the hangar bed gets out of the way — decision 111.
 *
 * The hangar music is **not** silenced for the whole cabinet session, and it is not ducked
 * either. It plays on under the bezel and the machine's menu — which is where you are picking
 * a pilot and reading a high score table, and where the room should still feel like the
 * hangar. The moment a RUN starts it fades to nothing over a few seconds and stays gone until
 * you leave the machine.
 *
 * **A latch, not a volume.** `SoundManager.stopAmbient(fadeOutMillis)` already owns the ramp,
 * on its own thread, in 20ms steps. The only thing with edges in it is *which single frame*
 * asks for that ramp, so that is all this decides — and the reason it is a class rather than
 * an `if` in the host is that the host is view code no test can reach, which is where every
 * escaped defect on this branch has lived.
 *
 * Shaped after [CabinetHeartbeat]: a small stateful helper the host ticks, returning true on
 * the frame something should happen.
