/**
 * What a finished reckoning writes to the save.
 *
 * **Only a WIN writes anything.** A loss leaves the save untouched and returns the player to the
 * bar in silence (decision 79, which retired decision 62). It still *resolves* — [apply] returns
 * true so the shell latches the run and stops re-applying it — it simply has nothing to record.
 *
 * **Extracted so it can be tested.** These writes used to live inline in `HangarSurfaceView`,
 * where nothing can reach them — and that is precisely where this feature's escaped defects have
 * landed twice: a unit test drives a unit, the host composes them, and the composition is what
 * breaks. The final review found a third of exactly that shape here, and the covering test could
 * not have caught it because it set only one of the two flags then in play. That defect is now
 * gone by construction rather than by guard: there is only one flag left to leave standing.
 *
 * Pure apart from the [PersistenceManager] it is handed, so a test can drive a real one under
 * Robolectric and assert what a whole outcome actually leaves behind.
