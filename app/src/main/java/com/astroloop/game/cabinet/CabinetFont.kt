/**
 * A stroke-drawn alphabet for BELT RUN.
 *
 * Text on this machine must be DRAWN, not typeset. A TTF would sit on top of the
 * picture — it would not bloom with the phosphor or flicker with the tube — so every
 * glyph here is a list of polylines and gets the vector treatment for free.
 *
 * Coordinates are on a 6-wide by 10-tall design grid, y down. Advance is 8 so glyphs
 * carry two units of side bearing; the face is monospaced, which is what a real score
 * table needs so digits line up in columns.

     * JUnit at all.

     * [width] is linear in size, so one measurement at [cap] gives the exact scale factor.
     * Returns [cap] untouched when it already fits, so a roomy column is not penalised for
     * a narrow one's sake.
     *
     * **Why this exists.** Device pass 7 found the high score board clipping. Its text was
     * sized from `lineHeight` — `reelHeight / 7`, a VERTICAL measure — while the panel it
     * had to fit is 15% of the machine's WIDTH, so "HIGH SCORE" rendered 386px wide inside
     * a 127px plate. The Exo 2 code it replaced never hit that because it carried a hard
     * `.coerceIn(12f, 20f)`. Deriving the size from the space available is what makes that
     * class of mistake unavailable rather than merely fixed.
