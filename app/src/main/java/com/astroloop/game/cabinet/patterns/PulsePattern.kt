/**
 * **PULSE** — expanding rings from centre, each with a gap that rotates between rings.
 *
 * *Can you read a gap and commit to it?* First in the teaching order, because it
 * establishes the grammar: the crystal emits, the emission has a way through, and finding
 * it is the game.
 *
 * **Its structural lull is the rest between bursts.** Three rings, then silence. Without
 * that rest, rings arrive forever at a fixed cadence and there is never a moment to turn
 * and shoot — which would make "the crystal is always damageable" true in principle and
 * false in practice.
 *
 * **The opening rule 1 measures is the GAP, not the arc between neighbouring bullets in a
 * ring.** A ring is a wall you pass through its hole; bullets on the wall are not a lane.
 * At engagement range the hole is 678.6px wide, so the binding constraint on lap 1 is the
 * *radial* distance between successive rings — which is also what tightens, and therefore
 * what makes escalation bite at lap 4.

     * 58), so late laps close the radial gap while this stays put — which is why the radial
