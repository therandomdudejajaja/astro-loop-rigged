/**
 * The player ship.
 *
 * Flies the way the main game's ship flies: a relative virtual joystick sets a target
 * velocity and the real velocity LERPS toward it. Heading follows travel and is
 * cosmetic to the motion — but it is what the gun fires along, which is what keeps
 * "shooting the crystal means flying at it" true when stage 2 lands.
 *
 * Pure: no Canvas, no Android. The one behaviour worth stating plainly is that this
 * ship does NOT stop when you let go — [CabinetMetrics.drag] is roughly a fifth of the
 * main game's, and the resulting glide is the cabinet's whole character. Device pass 2
 * replaced the steering above it and deliberately left the glide alone.
