/**
 * When the machine glitches, and how hard — decision 84.
 *
 * Once `CrystalReckoning.shouldEnter` is true the crystal is taking BELT RUN over, and the
 * cabinet has to say so before the player ever presses PLAY. This object owns the *decision*
 * — schedule, strength and jitter — and nothing else. It draws nothing and imports no
 * Android, which is what makes the one genuinely testable part of a view feature testable.
 * The four surfaces that consume it ([CRT], [MARQUEE], [BOARD], [MENU]) each turn these
 * numbers into strokes themselves.
 *
 * **Intermittent, not constant.** The register is a 1979 vector cabinet being pushed on from
 * inside, not a datamosh: constant heavy corruption reads as broken hardware, stops being
 * legible, and would have a player unable to find PLAY. So the machine is clean for
 * [CYCLE_MS] minus [EPISODE_MS] — a ~91% duty cycle of behaving itself — and comes apart in
 * brief episodes. That is also the cheap answer to decision 89's frame-time constraint:
 * outside an episode [intensity] returns 0, every caller early-outs, and the takeover costs
 * literally nothing. Frame time is a standing complaint, and
 * `ReckoningFairness.DENSITY_CEILING` says in as many words that this feature must not
 * make it worse.
 *
 * **Time-derived, not state.** A glitch is ambience, not simulation, so a clock is fair game
 * where the sim's patterns refuse `Random`. Everything here is a pure function of the wall
 * clock in milliseconds, which buys three things at once: no per-surface state to keep in
 * sync (all four tear on the same beat because they are asked the same question at the same
 * millisecond), nothing to reset when the overlay opens, and — because [noise] is quantised
 * to [STEP_MS] rather than re-rolled per call — a jitter that is identical at 30fps and at
 * 60fps. A frame-counter would have failed that last one.
 *
 * `% CYCLE_MS` before any float conversion is deliberate, and is the same trap the radio
 * wave hit: `System.currentTimeMillis()` is ~1.8e12 and loses precision as a float outright.
