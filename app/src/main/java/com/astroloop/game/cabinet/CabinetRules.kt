/**
 * What the cabinet knows about a pilot: their initials, and nothing else.
 *
 * This carried twelve per-pilot twists until device pass 2, when the owner cut them —
 * they are recoverable from git history if a future pass wants them back. What remains
 * is load-bearing three times over: the high score board ranks by initials, the HUD
 * strip shows them, and the stage 3 gate reads a per-pilot score table.
 *
 * The consequence is recorded rather than hidden: with no twists, the gate's twelve
 * runs are the same run twelve times. Original spec decision 10 existed to prevent
 * exactly that.
 *
 * **Settled 2026-08-21: accepted.** The reckoning is an easter egg rather than a
 * mandatory ending, so twelve identical runs is a price the player opts into rather than
 * one the game charges. Decision 10 is retired, not deferred — do not reintroduce the
 * twists to "fix" a gate that is no longer considered broken.

 * Initials are a CONSONANT SQUEEZE, settled 2026-08-14 after rendering three schemes on
 * a board. Plain truncation was rejected on evidence: it produces FAN, WHI, FRO and RAS,
 * which the eye reads as unrelated English words before it reads them as people — and
 * recognition is the only job these have. Astro is the exception, keeping AST.
