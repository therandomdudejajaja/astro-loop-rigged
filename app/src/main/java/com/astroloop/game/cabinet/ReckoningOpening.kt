/**
 * How the reckoning arrives: a stretch of ordinary BELT RUN, then the field crystallising
 * into the thing you fight.
 *
 * **Authored rather than played (decision 52).** The original design contradicted itself
 * here — decision 5 said the launch dissolves the hangar *into the cabinet*, while §8 said
 * *"You are playing a normal game when it arrives"* with rocks on the field to
 * crystallise. Both hold only if there is a stretch of BELT RUN first, and its length was
 * never specified.
 *
 * A scripted field and a fixed length settles it, and buys three things a live run cannot:
 * the entrance always has the same number of bodies, so the ending's quality does not vary
 * with how well the player was flying; it is deterministic; and **it does not depend on
 * wave pacing**, which is the one figure this project has repeatedly refused to guess.
 *
 * The player cannot tell a scripted wave from a random one, so §8's *"normal game"*
 * survives in the only sense that matters.
