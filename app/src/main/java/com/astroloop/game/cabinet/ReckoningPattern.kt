/**
 * One of the crystal's five attacks.
 *
 * Every pattern **declares its own fairness figures** and the harness checks the
 * declaration against what the pattern actually emits (decision 50). Declaring alone is
 * cheap and is how `CrystalFightSystem`'s tests stay three lines each — but a declaration
 * nothing verifies is precisely the failure this branch keeps catching, most sharply in
 * the stage 1 final review, where tests ran green over a path the product never took.
 * **A pattern must not be able to lie about itself.**
 *
 * Implementations are **pure and stateless**: everything derives from the phase-local
 * time [emit] is handed, so two directors fed identical `dt` produce identical fights and
 * a jump straight into phase N needs no warm-up.
