/**
 * What the crystal is saying, this frame — decision 81.
 *
 * Pure, and separated from the drawing for the reason this branch keeps relearning: a unit
 * test drives a unit, the host composes them, and the composition is what breaks. Three of
 * this feature's four escaped defects lived in a host where nothing could reach them. The
 * schedule is the part with edges in it, so the schedule is the part that gets tested.
 *
 * The gel strip is the crystal's own real estate — decision 35 made it red, and during the
 * reckoning it already carries the crystal's health rather than a score. Speaking there is
 * the crystal using a surface it has taken, which is the same idea decision 84 puts on the
 * cabinet itself.
 *
 * **Silence is authored, not absent.** Every branch here can return null, and most of a
 * phase is quiet: a lure that never stops talking is noise, and the pauses are what make
 * the next line arrive.
