/**
 * A draggable button that opens the debug menu, in debug builds only.
 *
 * **Raw device pixels, deliberately.** Both surface views render their content through a
 * `renderScale`, but the cabinet overlay is drawn unscaled — `HangarSurfaceView` routes cabinet
 * touches before the scale division for exactly that reason. Working in raw pixels means one
 * coordinate space for draw and hit-test in both views, and over the cabinet as well.
 *
 * **Tap versus drag is stage 1 Task 13's rule:** a press promotes to a drag on slop **or** on
 * elapsed time. Slop alone was the first version of that rule and it broke stationary holds; the
 * review caught it and the fix was the disjunction. Do not reduce it back to one condition.
 *
 * The caller owns the `BuildConfig.DEBUG` gate at both the draw and the touch site. This class does
 * not check it — a unit test needs to exercise it regardless of build type.
