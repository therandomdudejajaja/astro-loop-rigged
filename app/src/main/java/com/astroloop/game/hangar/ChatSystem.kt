     * ASTRO is the exception: his memory is allowed to be clearer, because he is the one the
     * loop is about.

     * No display swap runs on this path, and none is needed: Tobar only exists in astro-loop
     * mode, and by then the whole roster is already recruited, so recruitment never fires there.

     * Authoring: keep each line inside its speaker's chat-column budget — roughly 55-59 chars
     * worst-case, WHISKERS being the tightest at 55. Never put "commander" in a pilot's mouth;
