 * crystal, never aiming. That is the point — it establishes a LOWER bound, and a crystal
 * it can kill is one a human can certainly kill. It reuses `CabinetAttract.aim()`'s shape,
 * a pure policy driving `sim.update()`, which is already extracted, deterministic under an
 * injected `Random`, and settled.
 *
 * [perfectFire] is deliberately IMPOSSIBLE: parked on the firing line, immune, never
 * needing to turn. It establishes the UPPER bound, and it is what device pass 6 proved
 * this file was missing — the old ceiling test was arithmetic, and the arithmetic was
 * wrong, so the crystal died before CURTAIN on a first attempt and two authored patterns
