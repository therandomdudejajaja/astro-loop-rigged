/**
 * A jackpot's free upgrade must not be granted while the reels are still turning.
 *
 * The payout is the reveal: banking it at roll time meant the store tile had already gained a
 * level before the third reel landed, so the machine told the player the answer before it showed
 * it to them. The yen payout was always deferred to the stop; the upgrade was not.
 *
 * `roll = 0f` is below every jackpot threshold in `handleSlotSpin` (the lowest is 0.001f), so it
 * forces a jackpot on any save without spinning until one turns up.
